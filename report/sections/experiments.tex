\section{Experiments}\label{sec:experiments}
We said that zero-knowledge provable computation is especially interesting in blockchain
environments, like cryptocurrencies, where users commit to transactions by means of a tree-mode of
hash.
We implemented and tested several combinations of cryptographic primitives for tree-path
verification, using the C\texttt{++} language and the facilities based on the Pinocchio protocol 
provided by the \texttt{libsnark} library.
In particular, we implemented:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Hash-agnostic Merkle trees.
  \item Hash-agnostic ABRs.
  \item SHA-256 (adapted from the versionprovided by \texttt{libsnark}).
  \item SHA-512.
  \item MiMC-256 (i.e.\ )
\end{itemize}
